# Greenhouse-Heating

This project revolves around providing a solution to reducing greenhouse gas emission as well as ensuring year-round cultivation of crops. The system is powered by renewable sources such as wind and solar which a microcontroller will monitor the greenhouse conditions keeping the roots of crops warm throughout winter. A water pump and heater together provide heat for the crops. Air and water temp sensors inform the system on when to turn on and off. The system is changeable depending on what the user prefers. The user can input the desired temperate as well as a minimum temperature for the system.

The PCB that was designed also runs with this system. The PCB and Arduino connection work as a battery level indictor providing lighting of LEDs to indicate the level of power stored within the batteries. All sensors as well as the relay that controls the pump are passthrough connections to the Arduino.
